It is a guessing game made using the random library of python in which player is given hints about a word. Then the player has to guess the letters of the word.  
The program selects a random word from a file. The length of selected word is displayed to the player.
Then player has to guess one letter at a time. (If there are multiple same letters in the word for eg. Toddler had two d's then both of them would be inserted at the same time).
Player is provided with 8 guesses.
When the player fails to guess all the letters of the word, the actual word is displayed and player loses.
If the player is able to guess all the letters in given number of guesses, then player wins.
